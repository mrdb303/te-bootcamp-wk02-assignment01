As a user, I want to play an 'incrementing game' based on a chocolate-infused hardy biscuit, available from a supermarket, notably the humble cookie.

As a user, I would like the game to consist of the ability to earn virtual cookies, by clicking on a representation of a cookie. As the 'cookie' is clicked with a mouse pointer, the number of cookies should increase.

As a user, I want a live counter to be shown on the page. This counter will increase at one second intervals. The counter should act as a method of assessing my progress, so that I can assess how many cookies I have accrued within the current timeframe.

As a user, I would like a game mechanic to be available to allow me to increase the amount of cookies I can earn. This should take the form of an in-game shop, where I can purchase extra items to increase my cookie output per click. The in-game shop should use an amount of cookies as the in-game currency.
