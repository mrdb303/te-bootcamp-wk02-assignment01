As a user, I would like a game mechanic to be available to allow me to increase the amount of cookies I can earn. This should take the form of an in-game shop, where I can purchase extra items to increase my cookie output per click. The in-game shop should use an amount of cookies as the in-game currency. 

As a user, I would like the cost of bonus items to be charged based on the value of additional cookies that the bonus item earns. For example, a high-priced bonus item should allow me to earn a high cookie throughput, whereas a bonus item that is keenly priced will increase the throughput, but at a lesser rate than a more expensive bonus item.

As a user, I would like a count shown on screen of the number of each type of item that I have purchased during the current game. 

As a user, I would like to see a count of the current number of cookies I have in my inventory.

As a user, I would like the option to be able to reset the game, so that bonus items, cookies per click and the cookies accumulated are all reset.
